# Security best practices for AWS Key Management Service<a name="best-practices"></a>

AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\) supports several security features that you can implement to enhance the protection of your encryption keys\. These features are described in detail in the [AWS Key Management Service Best Practices](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-kms-best-practices.pdf)\. These general guidelines do not represent a complete security solution\. Because not all best practices are appropriate for all situations, these are not intended to be prescriptive\.
