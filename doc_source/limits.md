# Limits<a name="limits"></a>

To make AWS KMS responsive and performant for all users, AWS KMS applies two types of limits\. Each limit is calculated independently for each Region of each AWS account\.

**Important**  
If you need to exceed these limits, you can request a limit increase in Service Quotas\. Use the [Service Quotas console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas) or the [RequestServiceQuotaIncrease](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/2019-06-24/apireference/API_RequestServiceQuotaIncrease.html) operation\. For details, see [Requesting a Quota Increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-increase.html) in the *Service Quotas User Guide*\. If Service Quotas for AWS KMS are not available in the AWS Region, please visit the [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home) and create a case\. 
+ [Resource limits](resource-limits.md): Limit the number of each type of AWS KMS resource\. 
+ [Rate limits](requests-per-second.md): Limit the number of requests for AWS KMS API operations in each second\.
